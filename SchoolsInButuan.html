   <strong>Why did I choose this school:</strong>
                        <br />
                        I chose to study in Father Saturnino Urios University it’s because of it’s a known school and there’s no other quality school in Surigao. My parents also wanted me to go to this school. Even if it’s far from home, I still wented to go to this school hoping to have a good future.

                        <strong>About Father Saturnino Urios University:</strong>
                        <br />
                        The students of the school were very noisy. Unlike in our place, there’s many students but not as loud as the students in FSUU. Eventually, I got used to it and become noisy myself. It’s funny how I was discouraged by it when still in first year. <br/><br/>My instructors were very friendly. Some of them became my close friends even after I graduate. But they don’t tolerate students to use the friendship they built to have an advantage to other students. I liked my instructors, even they are strict and terror sometimes.<br/><br/>The facilities were good. I always went to the internet lab and study area to study and research. Social Media Websites are not allowed but few only know how to use proxies to open those including me. Libraries are also good. There were many books to choose from and computerized data to easily search these books. All books have number codes and all of the codes were encoded in the computer. If we want to search for a book, we only type the keywords and then poof, it will show all the books that have that keyword. The school called it OPAC.

                        <strong>How long did it take to find a job after graduation:</strong>
                        <br />
                        After I graduated, It took me only two months to have a descent job. It’s hard to apply in a government but I was very fortunate to get in sooner.
